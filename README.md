# Success post prediction with Machine Learning

## Getting started

This repository contains the code for the example as required.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- Jupyter Notebook


## 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing into Jupyter Notebook

The first step is to explore the data and build a model. The notebook is available in the `notebooks` folder.

- open the notebook `notebooks/01-EDA_Preprocessing.ipynb`

the notebook contains the following steps:

1 - Check missing values

2 - Check data types

3 - Detect numerical and categorical variables

4 - Analyze and Preprocessing numerical variables

5 - Analyze and Preprocessing categorical variables
